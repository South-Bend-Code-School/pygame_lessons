# ðŸŽ® One-Button Game Challenge 
 
**Objective:** 
Brainstorming, scoping, and plan a simple **one-button** 2D game you can build in Pygame.  

This constraint-based challenge encourages **creativity** while keeping the **scope manageable**.  

---

## Rules

The rule is simple.  Design a 2D game that you can play with only one button!

### Great games donâ€™t need complex controls.  

Here are a few example games that work with only one button!
  - *Flappy Bird* â€“ Tap to flap.
  - *Canabalt* â€“ Tap to jump in an endless runner.
  - *Jetpack Joyride* â€“ Hold to go up, release to go down.
  - *Altoâ€™s Adventure* â€“ Tap to jump and perform tricks.

- **Constraint:** Students must design a game that only uses **ONE BUTTON for input.**
  - No movement keys.
  - No mouse aiming.
  - No multiple actionsâ€”just **tap, hold, or release**.

- **Whatâ€™s possible with one button?**
  - **Jumping** (timing-based platformers).
  - **Flapping or floating** (like *Flappy Bird*).
  - **Switching gravity** (like *VVVVVV*).
  - **Charging an action** (like a golf shot).
  - **Rhythm-based actions** (like *Geometry Dash*).

### **2. Brainstorming Game Ideas (20 min)**
**(Students work in groups of 3-4 to brainstorm within the one-button constraint.)**  
- **Prompt:** "You only have **one button**â€”what can your player do?"
- **Game Types (Choose One)**
  - **Jump Timing:** Press to jump gaps (*Flappy Bird* style).
  - **Hold & Release:** Charge and release a power meter (*golf* or *bow & arrow*).
  - **Auto-Run Platformer:** Player runs automatically, press to jump (*Canabalt*).
  - **Switching Mechanic:** Flip gravity, swap between lanes, or teleport.
  - **Endless Climber:** Player slowly falls unless button is held (*Doodle Jump* variation).

- **Deliverable:** Each group **writes down their game idea in one sentence.**
  - Example: *"A ninja automatically runs forward, and pressing the button makes them jump over obstacles."*

### **3. Defining Game Requirements (20 min)**
**(Groups create a basic game blueprint.)**  
- **Fill out a game planning sheet:**
  - **Game Name**
  - **Objective (How do you win?)**
  - **What does the button do?** *(Tap? Hold? Release?)*
  - **Main Character**
  - **Enemy/Obstacle**
  - **Assets Needed (Sprites, Background, Sounds)**

- **Example Blueprint:**
