This guide will help you set up your first game using Pygame! Following these steps, you can run your game and modify it to create something unique.

### **Download the Game Starter Code**

Download the file [`game.py`](game.py) and save it to your computer. This file contains the basic game loop and player movement to get you started.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">

    <div>

    <a href="../game.py" download class="md-button md-button--primary">

    </a>

### **Create a New Project Folder**

- Choose an appropriate name for your game, such as `MyAwesomeGame`, `Asteroids`, or `SpaceRunner`. 
    - Your project's folder name should not contain spaces or special characters. 
    - Use capital letters to separate words.
- On your computer, create a new folder with your game's name. 
    - This will be your project folder where all your game files and assets will be stored.

!!! note "What are Project Folders?"
    A project folder helps you keep all your game files organized in one place. As your game grows, you’ll need more than just the `game.py` file. Your project folder will store:

    - **Game Code:** The Python files that run your game.
    - **Images:** Graphics like backgrounds, characters, and objects.
    - **Sounds:** Background music and sound effects.
    - **Instructions/README:** A file explaining how to play the game.

    Keeping everything in one folder makes finding and managing your game assets easier.

### **Move the Game File**

- Move `game.py` into your newly created project folder.

As you start adding images and sounds, your project folder should evolve to look like this:

```
MyAwesomeGame/
├── game.py           # Main game file
├── assets/           # Folder for images and sounds
│   ├── player.png    # Example player image
│   ├── background.png # Example background
│   ├── jump.wav      # Example sound effect
```

This structure keeps your project organized, making you less likely to encounter errors when referencing files.

!!! note "File Naming Best Practices"

    When naming files in your project, always use **lowercase letters (`a-z`)** with **underscores (`_`)** between words. Filenames are case-sensitive, so be consistent!

    | ✅ Good File Name   | ❌ Bad File Name                        |
    |----------------------|----------------------------------------|
    | `player_ship.png`    | `Player Ship.png` (spaces & uppercase) |
    | `laser_blast.wav`    | `Laser_blast.PNG` (inconsistent case)  |

    Keeping filenames lowercase and using underscores prevents errors in your code.

### **Open Your Project in Visual Studio Code**

- Open **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.
- Click on **File > Open Folder...** and select your game project folder.
