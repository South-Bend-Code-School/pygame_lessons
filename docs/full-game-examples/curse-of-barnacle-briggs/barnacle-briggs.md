![The Curse of Barnacle Briggs](title_screen.jpeg){height=200px}

Ahoy, mate! I be Captain Barnacle Briggs, the only poor soul left from the crew of the Black Squall, and I’ve come to beg fer yer forgiveness—and yer help. We were a wicked lot, pillagin’ treasures that weren’t ours, and our greed sealed our doom. 

Among the gold and gems we plundered was the Emerald Heart, a jewel green as the sea and large as a boulder. What we didn’t know was that the heart wasn’t just treasure—it was the very soul of yer island. The storm that tore our ship apart was no natural gale but the wrath o’ the cursed heart itself, draggin’ us to the bottom of the sea. The rest o’ me crew lies as bones scattered on the ocean floor, and me? I’m doomed to haunt these shores till the curse is lifted.

This curse be no longer just my burden—it’s brought ruin to yer village as well. The seas rage, crops wither, and shadows grow darker with each passing day. 

The Emerald must be returned to its rightful place, at the heart of your land, or the island will never know peace again. 

I can’t do it alone, mate. I need someone with courage enough to face the perils of the deep, to brave the monsters and the unknown, and help me right this terrible wrong. 

**What say ye, friend? Will ye help a cursed old sea dog atone for his sins and save yer island?**
